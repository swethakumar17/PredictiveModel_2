In the dataset dataset.csv, we are provided a data on cybersecurity that can be classified into either of the 2 classes mentioned below.
Benign (stands for harmless)

We have analyzed the data using three different algorithms namely Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes by presenting the confusion matrix and classification report.
We will try and further identify key insights (precision, f1 score etc.) from our analysis and recommend a method to be utilized.
